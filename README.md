# JDBC-Example

unlike ORM frameworks like hibernate and jpa where we connect to our databases by the help of spring boot and we dont really need to write any db query in our applications with the help of repositories,
i wanted to build very small application where i would first, register driver for the connection ( i used MySql so i had to download mysql jdbc jar file and add to my project )
and then write queries like i would write in an actual database ( SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE )
jdbc is very interesting.
